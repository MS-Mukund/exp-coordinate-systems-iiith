This experiment is designed to teach how points and co-ordinate systems are represented in computer graphics. The tree at the right shows a point and the associated co-ordinate system.

Start by editing the co-ordinates of the point and comparing how the point gets displayed. The co-ordinates can be edited by clicking on the node under **Instance->Shape->Vertices**

Now try modifying the co-ordinate system's origin and axis directions. This can be done by clicking on the nodes under **Instance->Co-ordinate System**. Notice how the point is redrawn using the modified co-ordinate system. Also notice how the absolute co-ordinates are displayed.

All points shown within '[' and ']' use homogeneous co-ordinates, i.e., the fourth component **w** acts as a scaling factor for calculating the cartesian co-ordinates. Modify this component and notice how the point's co-ordinates get scaled.

You can also modify the absolute co-ordinates of the point and see how the relative co-ordinates get calculated with respect to the co-ordinate system.

This scene is currently shown in 2D but you can switch to 3D under the Display tab and perform all the previous actions in 3D. Drag with the right mouse button to rotate the view and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
